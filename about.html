If you just jumped straight to the about me page from the <a href="C:\Users\The Boss\Desktop\Shana Port\index.html">home</a>
page. My name is Shana Parker and I am currently a Front-End student at Grand Circus. Prior to joining the bootcamp I worked in retail and retail
management for nine years. I tried coding from the sugestion of my father and an attempt to fill a need a work. My first go was with Girl
Develop IT. The first attempt at a website was really bad and I was lost the first night, however there was something in me that wanted to learn
more. I did some research and came across Grand Circus, I attended a open house and was hooked.
